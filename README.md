Overview Of the Project

Project: SIMPLE BLOG APPLICATION

Objective

Frontend Development:

Create an intuitive and user-friendly interface to:
Display a list of all blog posts on the home page.
Provide a View page to display individual blog post details.
Include forms to Create and Edit blog posts.
Enable users to Delete blog posts easily.
Backend Development:

Develop a backend server to handle API requests for:
Fetching all blog posts.
Fetching details of a single blog post.
Adding new blog posts.
Editing existing blog posts.
Deleting blog posts.
Implement data validation and error handling in the backend.
Database Integration:

Use a database (e.g., MongoDB or PostgreSQL) to store and manage blog post data.
Ensure proper schema design for the blog posts (e.g., fields like title, content, timestamp, etc.).
Full-Stack Integration:

Ensure the frontend interacts seamlessly with the backend via API endpoints.
Implement dynamic updates on the frontend, reflecting any changes (create, edit, or delete) made to the blog posts.
Technical and Functional Goals:

Ensure the application is functional, reliable, and scalable.
Focus on a clean and responsive UI for better user experience.
Handle edge cases (e.g., empty lists, invalid data, or failed operations) gracefully.
End Goal:
To build a fully functional, interactive blog management application that demonstrates understanding and integration of frontend, backend, and database systems in a cohesive manner. The resulting app should provide CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) capabilities for blog posts with a smooth user experience.
